# **Introduction to the Powers of R**

# **Summary**
.pull-left[
- **R is a statistical programming language**: Primarily used for statistics and data science
- **Rich ecosystem**: Wide range of statistics-related libraries
- **Popular in academia, government, and data analysis roles**
- **Developed in the early 1990s**
- **Works with 2D dataframes**, similar to Python's Pandas library

# **R vs Python**
### Key Differences

- **Indexing**: R is **1-indexed**, whereas Python is **0-indexed**
- **Learning curve**: R has a slightly steeper learning curve but is widely used in non-CS fields
- **Performance**: The difference in speed is not huge; certain tasks are better suited for one of the other but this isn't a big deal

# **RStudio: The IDE for R**

.pull-left[
- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** for R
- **Not required (you can use VS Code)** but many prefer it
- **Tracks all loaded data**: dataframes, vectors, primitives (strings, ints, etc.)
- **Built-in CSV viewer**
- **Built-in R terminal**

# **R Markdown**

.pull-left[
- **Similar to Jupyter Notebooks**, but for R
- Lets you **Mix code and markdown**
- **Run code in sections**: `Run -> Run Current Chunk` or `Ctrl+Shift+Enter`
- **Generates HTML output** from executed code
- **Can create interactive slideshows and Word documents**

# **Basic R Syntax**
### Before We Start

- **File Extensions**: `.R` for base R, `.Rmd` for R Markdown
- **Comments**: `#` for single-line comments
- **Variable Assignment**: Uses `<-` instead of `=`
  ```r
  x <- 10  # Assigns 10 to x
  ```
- **Printing Output**: Use `print()`, but last item in a block is printed automatically
  ```r
  y <- 20
  y  # Prints y
  ```

---

# **Vectors & Indexing**
### Creating Vectors

```r
vec1 <- c(1,2,3)
vec2 <- c(2,4,6)
```

### Indexing
- Dataframe indexing uses **row, column format**
  ```r
  A[1, 2]  # Row 1, Column 2
  ```
- **Remember:** R indices **start at 1**, not 0!

---

# **Functions & Piping**
### Defining Functions
```r
functionname <- function(arguments) {
  # Do some stuff
}
```

### Using Pipes (`%>%`)

- Pipes allow chaining functions for **readability**
- Example:
  ```r
  round(exp(diff(log(x))), 1)
  ```
  **is the same as**
  ```r
  x %>% log() %>% diff() %>% exp() %>% round(1)
  ```
- **Think of pipes as:** *This* and *Then*

name: Libraries

# Libraries
```{r}
# import statements
library(tidyverse) 
# Most important one, has a ton of stuff
library(readr) # To read CSV
library(plotly) # Interactive visualizations, python has its own version
library(DT) # to transfer interactive tables to js
library(readxl) # To read excel files
library(wordcloud) # for wordcloud
library(leaflet) # for interactive maps
library(knitr)
```

`library(<library_name>)` is the R equivalent of importing python packages

# Reading in Data (& output)

```{r}
# TODO: Read in dogs.csv
```

# Basic Data Manipulation
```{css, echo = F}
table {
  font-size: 12px;     
}
```



```{r}
# TODO: Create a table with the 25 youngest dogs
```



---

# Simple Data Exploration
### Helps you get a brief idea of what you're looking at

```{r}
# Print summary information about the data
summary(zips_data)
```


# Print/Display Data
.pull-left[
```{r eval=TRUE}
# TODO: Read in zips.xlsx and display a few of its lines
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r eval=TRUE}
# TODO: Add column names to the zip codes (ZipCode and Population)
```
]

### No need for a print statement!

---

# GGplot2 bar graph

```{r fig.dim=c(6,3), out.width="80%"}
# TODO: Create a bar chart with ggplot comparing the total number of dogs of each breed

```


---

# Sorted Plot

```{r fig.dim=c(6,3), out.width="80%"}
# TODO: Increase the amount of data, add tilted x labels, add data labels, sort it in descending order

```

---

# Interactive plot (plotly)

```{r fig.dim=c(6,5), out.width="80%"}
# TODO: Build an interactive equivalent of the plot above using plotly
```



---

# Combining datasets

```{r}
```

---

# `Select` to filter out columns
```{r}
# TODO: TODO: Select only a few important columns (set aside the three useless ones)
simple_dog <- dog_data %>% select('AnimalName', 'AnimalBirthYear', 'AnimalGender', 'BreedName', 'ZipCode')
head(simple_dog,5)

```

---

# `Filter` to filter out rows
### `Arrange` is another way to sort

```{r}
# TODO: Find all the dogs named Fido ("FIDO" by the standards of the dataset) and sort them by descending Birth Year and then Breed Name
```

---

# `Mutate` to create new column

```{r}
# TODO: Create a crude age column by subtracting the dog's birth year from 2025
```

---

# `Count` for counting

```{r}
# TODO: Count the number of male vs female dogs in the dataset
```

- Returns a table with two columns, the thing you're counting, and its value

---

# Word Counting

```{r}
## Word Cloud requires a table with the word and the number of occurrences
# TODO: Count up the number of occurrences of each name, filter out the following common entries that aren't names: "UNKNOWN", "NAME NOT PROVIDED", "NOT"
```

---

# Word Cloud Function
```{r}
# TODO: Build a wordcloud of the most common dog names

```


# Lat/long data
```{r}
lat_long <- read_csv("data/lat_long.csv")
head(lat_long,3)
```


##  Merging
```{r}
# TODO: Merge simple_dog with lat_long to acquire the latitude and longitude of each dog's zip code
```

---

# Challenge: Boston Terrier data trimming
```{r}
# We're going to create a bubble map visualizing Boston Terrier population in NYC
# Ingredients: dog_data, zips_data, lat_long
# Hint: Use filter, select, count, merge (twice), and mutate
# For each zip code, we need the latitude, longitude, and terriers per 10000 people (call this column Density for the sake of the exercise)

```

---

# Maps!

```{r}
# The syntax for making the actual maps is a little insane so we've included the mostly complete code to build the map
mybins <- seq(0, 36, by=(36/9))
mypalette <- colorBin( palette="YlOrRd", domain=<TODO>,
na.color="transparent", bins=mybins)

map <- leaflet(<TODO>) %>% # TODO
  addTiles() %>%
    setView(-74.00, 40.71, zoom = 12) %>%
  addCircleMarkers(~Longitude, ~Latitude,
    fillColor = ~mypalette(<TODO>), fillOpacity = 1, #TODO
    color="white", radius=~(<TODO>/(35/12))+5, stroke=FALSE) #TODO
```
